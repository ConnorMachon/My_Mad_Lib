      <article id="orig-story">
        <p>Four hundred years ago people knew little about our mysterious universe.</p>  
        
        <p>They thought that the Earth was the center of the entire solar system and that the sun and all of the planets revolved around it.</p>

        <p>But then a/an Polish man named Copernicus discovered the truth: The Earth revolves around the Sun 1 time(s) a year.</p>

        <p>Copernicus, whose full name is Nicolaus Copernicus, was born in Warsaw, and made observations with the naked eye, long before Galileo used a refracting telescope.</p>

        <p>In 1600, Galileo Galilei, an Italian Scientist, expanded Corpernicus' revolutionary theories, but during the Inquisition in Italy, he was then arrested.</p>

        <p>After suffering for six months in jail, Galileo was forced to spend the rest of his life on house arrest.</p>
